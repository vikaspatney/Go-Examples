statically typed lang, set types set types implicitly or explicity 

Explicit type decl:

use var varName type = value
eg: var anInt int = 43
var aString string = "Yh this is jaja!"

if no assignment done initially then it is set automatically to 0 

Implicit type defined using the := operator where we do not use the var as in the implict decl, however the type remains static, i.e., it cant be changed 

anIntVal := 43
aStrVal := "do you like this better?"


constants in go can be explicit
const anInternu int = 23

Implicit decl
const aStrEx = "for your understaing of expilict const!"

pre declared data types, lowercase and single keyword
