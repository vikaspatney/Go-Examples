GoFMT or Go format installed with Go

go env to display the go env variables

https://golang.org/doc/code.html reference for how to code in GO 

to change or set the vars use export or set on cmd 
in order to use the go install command one must create a new folder like gowork and within src/ bin/ pkg/
export GOPATH=E:/D-Drive-Win/LinkedInTraining/Go/gowork

to set GOPATH to set it back to the earlier val 
go env -u GOPATH or 
export GOPATH=C:/Usres/Vikas/go

one can also modify the set GOOS=windows value to either darwin64 etc to generate the operating system specific exe 
every variable defined in the code must be used otherwise it will lead to an error
in order to avoid this error for the variables you know will be returned by the function; we can use _ or underscore to tell the compiler to skip this var
